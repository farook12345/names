INTRODUCTION 


This book started with the realization that I did not know the meaning of my name. All 
I knew was that Menaka (I spell it Maneka) was the name of an apsara in the court of 
Indra. No one I had encounte: — new the:meaning of their names either. Like me, 
they had been named after hist..:ical or mythological people. I hunted for a book, but 
while the libraries are full of information about the gods, I did not come across one book 
in India which gave the meaning of the name. What docs Sarasvati mean? No, not 
‘learning’ even though she is the goddess of that, but ‘full of water’. Chandrashekhar 
does not mean Shiva but one who bears the moon on his forehead. I waited for someone 
to write a book but the two that emerged listed ‘Menaka’ as ‘apsara’. When my sister 
announced that a baby was on the way, I decided to compile the dictionary myself. 
Aaryaman is now almost four years old! 

The Vedic rishis believed that the name defined the child's character—its face, figure, 
temper, morals, tastes and profession. The name Anamika or ‘without a name’ for 
instance, would ensure that the child's future was what she wanted to make it—since 
she was not hedged in by any preordained limitations. Most of us look for phonetically 
pleasing names without realizing their significance. But Minna means ‘fat’ and Ambika 
means ‘little mother’, Sita means ‘furrow’, Mina means ‘fish’ and Draupadi has no 
meaning other than ‘daughter of Drupada’. A number of names which are very common 
do not have any meaning at all. Anita, Lina, Rina and Tina for instance, come from 
languages other than Indian. If Roma is of Indian origin it means ‘hairy’! The Phul, Sona 
and Pyar family (Phulvati; Phulrani, Sonalika, Sonam, Pyari) have no roots in Sanskrit, 
Pali or any of the classical Indian languages. Rishma and Rashmini simply do not exist. 
Malvika is a combination name that has no meaning. (There is however a plant of the 
Ipomoea family called Malvika.) My mother’s name Amteshwar is a corruption of, I 
think, Amritesvara or lord of the Amrita. Alternatively it has no meaning at all. Names 
like Bina are distortions of Vina (the musical instrument), Bihari is not from Bihar, for 
instance, but from Vihari or roamer. I have left out the local versions of the classical 
name (Poonam comes from Purnima, Rakhi from Rakshaka, for instance) or the local 
diminutives or corruptions (e.g. Lacchman or Lakha for Lakshman, Upinder for 
Upendra, Vanti for Vati). The only exception I have made is for Rima which is a 
corruption of Hrim—since this happens to be my copy editor's name! _ 

A lot of the names in India are combination names. Two primary names (usually of 
two gods or of a god and goddess) taken and made into one. For instance Ramakrishna 
or Radheshyam and in some cases, the conjoining of two gods produces an entirely new 
deity. I have tried to give as many combinations as possible, especially where there.is a 
historical or mythological person with that compound. However the compounds can be 
infinite—and a lot of distortion of the primary names takes place in the mixture, Punjab 
is fullof Gurveens, Tarveens, Harleens, Hargurbirinders and Harkirats, Some combina- 
tions are unique to certain regions in the country. The suffixes of Jit, Mita and 
Inder/Indra to the main name are usually from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Swamy, 


Appa, Amma show Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The nagas or serpents who formed such 
an integral part of pre-Vedic and Vedic mythology are now confined to south and east 
India—e.g. Seshan, Nagabhushan, Phenamani. Even Manasa, the goddess of serpents, 
is a name far more common in Bengal than anywhere else in India. 

The entries in this dictionary have been designed so that each entry is divided into 
three categories: : 

1. The exact or literal meaning. For instance Menaka means ‘daughter of Mena’. 

2. Theintended meaningor rather, the meaning of the meaning. Menaka's intended 
meaning is *of the mountains' because, in Indian mythology, Mena is the consott of 
Himavan who is the lord of the Himalayas. 

3. This is divided into two sub-categories. The first is the locating of the name in 
mythology, history, literature, botany or ornithology. If the name denotes a person out 
of mythology, history or literature I have tried to give the name of the mythological 
consort, the children and the name of the dynasty, as well as the names of Sanskrit Vedic 
commentators, grammarians and playwrights. I have included the names that come from 
plants, trees, birds and animals along with their Latin and English names. 

The last sub-category is ‘another name for—’. In Menaka’s case, it is ‘another name 
for Parvati’ as Parvati was born a daughter of Himavan in her incarnation as Uma. (The 
name Parvati also means of the mountains.) 

I have read the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Kathasaritsagara, the 
Panchatantra, the listings of all the Vedas and Upanishads, books on Sanskrit plants and 
birds, the catalogues that list the thousand names of each major god, Vedic and Puranic 
encyclopaedias and the Buddhist and Jaina mythologies and histories and, of course, 
Sanskrit dictionaries to unearth the meanings of the names in this dictionary. Very often 
the meaning of the name sounds bizarre unless one knows the context. Aparna which 
is another name for Parvati in her incarnation as Himavan’s daughter means ‘leafless’. 
"This is explained by the legend of Parvati fasting to marry Shiva. 

One result of this search has been new and unexpected perceptions into the tradi- 
tional Indian way of life. For instance, what is truth? Or again, what is right and what is : 
wrong? Jaya and Vijaya were the two door-keepers of Vishnu’s palace in Vaikuntha. 
One day they were cursed by Lakshmi to be reborn on the earth as mortals. Vishnu 
modified the curse on his two devoted servants by saying that if they were killed thrice 
by him, they could come back to Vaikuntha. Jaya and Vijaya chose to be reborn as the 
most evil (or what we define as evil within the parameters of morality set by our religion) 
asuras or anti-gods Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu, Ravana and Kumbhakarna, 
Shisupala and Dantavaktra so that their deaths at the hands of Vishnu—in his incarna- 
tion of Narasimha, Rama and Krishna—became quick and inevitable. So were these 
asuras good or bad? It was inevitable that Sita be separated from Rama for she had 
imprisoned a pregnant female parrot and had been cursed by the consort of the parrot 
to suffer the same fate. So, is Rama to be blamed for listening to the jibes ofa washerman 
or was his action inevitable? Krishna means dark or black and Arjuna fair or white. They 
are reborn from Nara and Narayana or man and superman/god. Do they represent 
people or the Eastern philosophy of yin and yang, two opposites that fuse to complete? 
Ifind my attitude towards people and current affairs, goals and achievements, and even 


the pursuit ofhappiness or rather the diminishing of pain has changed with the unfolding 
of the history of each mythological character. ; 


I would like to thank all the people who helped me in the preparation of this book. 
The friends who brought in the odd name in the beginning, those who pitched in to type 
the manuscript over and over again, the pandits and Sanskrit teachers who corrected 
my mistakes, the editors at Penguin who put the work into order and spent hours 
proof-reading and inserting new words till the last minute. I have used the Sanskrit 
classical style of spelling with diacritical marks, to help in the correct pronunciation of 
the names.

The product of several years of research, The 
Penguin Book of Hindu Names isa comprehensive 


compilation of Hindu names in current use. The 
meaning of each of the approximately 20,000 
names in the volume is extensively discussed and 
information on sources and usage is also provided. 
The book is cross-referenced to make it easier to 
use. The aim of the work is twofold: to serve as a 
practical guide for parents choosing a name for 
their offspring; and to provide a precise and 
in-depth sourcebook for scholars, pandits and lay 
readers who would like to know what familiar (and 
not so familiar) Hindu names actually mean. 
"Good, serious, authoritative research well 
presented."
